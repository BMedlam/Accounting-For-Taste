Hi folks!

My name is Benedict Medlam, welcome to my capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science Diploma. 

My project title is, "Pedicting London Property Characteristics that Make for a Successful Airbnb Rental".

I will use a range of statistical models and machine learning methods throughout this project (exact ML methods are TBC).

Currently, I have a range of foundational EDA visualisations and a linear regression model. These have provided some initial insights, helping guide the direction of future analysis. 

The raw dataset can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14V8xvV-zEi3BQL_vw8zzeocy-NqUCeCu/view?usp=sharing

The notebooks in order are as follows:
